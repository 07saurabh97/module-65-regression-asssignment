Standardization:\n","Elastic Net often benefits from standardizing the predictors (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). This means that the coefficients represent the change in the target variable for a one standard deviation change in the predictor.\n","When predictors are standardized, you can compare the magnitudes of the coefficients directly to see which predictors have a greater effect on the target variable.\n","3.
